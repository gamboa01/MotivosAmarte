    <span data-start="17" data-end="19">Oh, her eyes, her eyes</span>
    <span data-start="19" data-end="22">Make the stars look like they're not shinin'</span>
    <span data-start="22" data-end="24">Her hair, her hair</span>
    <span data-start="24" data-end="27">Falls perfectly without her trying</span>
    <span data-start="27" data-end="30">She's so beautiful</span>
    <span data-start="30" data-end="34">And I tell her every day</span>
    <span data-start="34" data-end="37">Yeah, I know, I know</span>
    <span data-start="37" data-end="40">When I compliment her, she won't believe me</span>
    <span data-start="40" data-end="41">And it's so, it's so</span>
    <span data-start="41" data-end="44">Sad to think that she don't see what I see</span>
    <span data-start="44" data-end="48">But every time she asks me: Do I look okay?</span>
    <span data-start="48" data-end="51">I say</span>
    <span data-start="51" data-end="56">When I see your face</span>
    <span data-start="56" data-end="60">There is not a thing that I would change</span>
    <span data-start="60" data-end="63">'Cause you're amazing</span>
    <span data-start="63" data-end="69">Just the way you are</span>
    <span data-start="69" data-end="74">And when you smile</span>
    <span data-start="74" data-end="78">The whole world stops and stares for a while</span>
    <span data-start="78" data-end="80">'Cause, girl, you're amazing</span>
    <span data-start="80" data-end="88">Just the way you are, yeah</span>
    <span data-start="88" data-end="90">Her lips, her lips</span>
    <span data-start="90" data-end="93">I could kiss them all day if she let me</span>
    <span data-start="93" data-end="94">Her laugh, her laugh</span>
    <span data-start="94" data-end="97">She hates, but I think it's so sexy</span>
    <span data-start="97" data-end="99">She's so beautiful</span>
    <span data-start="99" data-end="105">And I tell her everyday</span>
    <span data-start="105" data-end="107">Oh, you know, you know</span>
    <span data-start="107" data-end="110">You know I'd never ask you to change</span>
    <span data-start="110" data-end="112">If perfect's what you're searching for</span>
    <span data-start="112" data-end="114">Then just stay the same</span>
    <span data-start="114" data-end="118">So don't even bother asking if you look okay</span>
    <span data-start="118" data-end="122">You know I'll say</span>
    <span data-start="122" data-end="126">When I see your face</span>
    <span data-start="126" data-end="131">There is not a thing that I would change</span>
